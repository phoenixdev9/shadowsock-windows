How to Contribute
=================

Pull Requests
-------------

1. Pull requests are welcome. If you would like to add a large feature
or make a significant change, make sure to open an issue to discuss with
people first.
2. Make sure to pass the unit tests. Write unit tests for new modules if
needed.

Issues
------

1. Only bugs and feature requests are accepted here.
2. Nobody has reported any bugs but posted a lot of questions in the last
few months. So we're closing the issue tracker.
